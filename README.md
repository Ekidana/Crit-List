# Crit List

DEMO: https://critlist.jamibot.com
I'm working on a version with some extra features which I'll be releasing for IOS and Android soon. The higher version is also what's seen in the demo.

This project accompanies the [Jami Bot](https://jamibot.com) YouTube video [Ionic 4 Full App Tutorial (Part 1)](https://youtu.be/fiRmjngNALA).

The perfect minimal todo list for tracking critical tasks.

## Installation

Download or clone this project, then run `npm i` from the project directory to install its dependencies. Not familiar with NPM? Check out my [NPM Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzs-N5hXGuQ).

## Development server

Run `ionic serve -c` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8100/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

You can also view the app in the Ionic DevApp from your mobile device: [Ionic DevApp Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAR-7eggWMs).
